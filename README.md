# About the Project

**Writing hard coded SQL queries is a subject of great concern amongst developers!**
It not just lets your code 'dirty' (as some PHP purists might say) but also affects
testability, simplicity and impose more work over development. With those in mind
this package comes in handy with a simple approach of wrapping SQL queries into PHP
classes and methods, providing an abstraction with easy-to-use syntax and extra
features to assert the queries are being written accordingly.

Also bear in mind this package was developed for educational purposes goal.


## Installation

Installation is super-easy via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
$ composer require jayrods/querybuilder
```

or add it by hand to your `composer.json` file.


## Upgrading

We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), which means breaking
changes may occur between major releases. We would introduce upgrading guides
whenever major version releases becomes available [here](UPGRADING.md).


## Getting Started

After installing the package via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
you should simply instanciate the QueryBuilder object as bellow:

```php
use Jayrods\QueryBuilder\QueryBuilder;

$builder = new QueryBuilder();
```

The `builder` object is actually a factory, which have a `QueryBuilder::create`
method to resolve and instantiate suited QueryBuilder class for each use-case.
Follow bellow examples of different instances generated by the `create` method:

```php
// Return an object to build DELETE queries.
$query = $builder->create(QueryBuilder::DELETE);

// Return an object to build INSERT queries.
$query = $builder->create(QueryBuilder::INSERT);

// Return an object to build SELECT queries.
$query = $builder->create(QueryBuilder::SELECT);

// Return an object to build UPDATE queries.
$query = $builder->create(QueryBuilder::UPDATE);
```

where the class constants are provided to represent the values:

```php
QueryBuilder::DELETE = 'delete';
QueryBuilder::INSERT = 'insert';
QueryBuilder::SELECT = 'select';
QueryBuilder::UPDATE = 'update';
```

by convention, we encourage you to use the provided constants for a
more readable and standardized code instead of use the string values directly.

### Use Notes

When a new developer clones your codebase, they will have an additional
one-time step to manually copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill-in
their own values (or get any sensitive values from a project co-worker).


## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability within this package, please report the issue or send an

will be promptly addressed. We appreciate your concern.
