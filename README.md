# About the Project

**Writing hard coded SQL queries is a subject of great concern amongst developers!**
It not just lets your code 'dirty' (as some PHP purists might say) but also affects
testability, simplicity and impose more work over development. With those in mind
this package comes in handy with a simple approach of wrapping SQL queries into PHP
classes and methods, providing an abstraction with easy-to-use syntax and extra
features to assert the queries are being written accordingly.

Also bear in mind this package was developed for educational purposes goal.

their own values (or get any sensitive values from a project co-worker).
